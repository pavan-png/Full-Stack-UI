             Continuity is the cornerstone of the newly formed Union council of ministers headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi 
             with no changes in not just the top four ministries, but also several others, from the outgoing National Democratic Alliance (NDA)
             government, in the portfolios announced on Monday. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which leads the NDA coalition government has
             retained most key portfolios, although there are five cabinet ministers from the coalition partners.

        <h2> There is no change in the big four ministries:</h2>
        <p id = "p2" class="CssClass"  >
        <b>  Rajnath Singh continues in defence; Amit Shah in home; Nirmala Sitharaman in finance; and S Jaishankar in external affairs</b>.This also means is no change in the composition of the cabinet committee on security (CCS), a crucial body
             headed by the PM that has the mandate for making appointments for national security bodies and taking decisions on issues of national security
             and defence expenditure.

            Some of the key changes were necessitated by the need to accommodate party <b class = "newsSubheading"> chief JP Nadda </b>  he has been given the portfolio of health and family

            Other changes were necessitated by the need to replace ministers who lost the election, or were dropped from the cabinet, and the need to accommodate allies.

            Rajya Sabha MP Ashwini Vaishnaw has retained railways and ministry of electronics and information technology but has also been given charge of the ministry of
            information and broadcasting, which was previously handled by Anurag Thakur who did not find a place in the council of ministers despite winning his seat. 
            Jyotiraditya Scindia, who won from Guna, has been given charge of telecommunications and development of the North East Region; he was handling civil aviation
            in the second Modi government, but that has been allocated to an ally. And Annpurna Devi, the MP from Koderma, has been given charge of the ministry of women and 
            child development, a portfolio that was handled by Smriti Irani, who lost the election from Amethi.
